APCS Help webpage - powers https://apcshelp.github.io

The purpose of this site is to create thoughtful explanations for common problems that are given in many AP Computer Science A classes. We would like to allow any programming problems whatsoever, however. We want this site to be a great resource for people to try new problems and challenge themselves to accomplish more.

## Have a problem to suggest or a solution to add?
We'd love to accept new problems or add solutions to existing problems. Please use the Github issues page to add issues. We probably won't accept PRs at this time, but if you notice something to change feel free to submit one and we will take a look.

Thank you, and enjoy the solutions!
